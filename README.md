# Runing R at CARC intro workshop

The following markdown files contain the introductory workshop material for running R on CARC systems. 

The "tutorials" go basically in this order:

1. getting R software
2. installing packages
3. PBS job submission
4. If I have time this will be a GNU parallel tutorial
